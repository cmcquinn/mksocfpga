# Further development of the mksocfpga project for the Snickerdoodle development board

This fork of mksocfpga is aimed at getting hostmot2 firmware running on the Snickerdoodle development board (http://krtkl.com), with a specific focus on developing a 3D printer configuration for mksocfpga. Most, if not all development is going on in the HW/VivadoProjects/snickerdoodle folder. You can find some information there about how I am building the firmware.
