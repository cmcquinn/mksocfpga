Right now the quartus design projectfiles behind the initial mesa 5i25 test design in the first socfpga machinekit sd-images is residing here in masterbranch of the mksocpga repo.

It has an avalon --> uio driver interface, ~~that hopefully shortly will be replaced with an axi interfacce.~~

Requirements to re-build the required quartus binaries:


Altera Quartus 15.1.2 prime lite
Altera Soc Eds

(Install into default altera/15.1 folder do not change paths...)

From Altera --> Download --> (update version)

Quartus prime 15.1.2  (on Debian.)(no license required for lite version)

    Download the complete download:
    Quartus-lite-15.1.2.193-linux.tar

    extract

    3. Change the file permission for all the setup (.run) files by running the command: chmod +x *.run.
 	4. Run the QuartusSetup-15.1.2.193-linux.run file.


Soc EDS: ( You do not have to install DS-5 )

   On download page click Soc Eds
   download:


 	 SoC Embedded Design Suite (EDS)
    Size: 2.3 GB MD5: 7FE507F3A29652E3529FA6432AA9E165 - See more at: http://dl.altera.com/soceds/?edition=standard#sthash.lUOCRFVv.dpuf

 	extract and chmod +x as before

 	Run the SoCEDSSetup-15.1.1.60-linux.run file   (first as normal user)

 	Read and follow instructions.

 	Run afterwards the suggested script file a root.
 	Install all suggested dependencies. (trick: install all the mentioned missing libraries apt-source packages in a separate konsole window)
 	(What I did was to search for the file on https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages#search_packages then put the apt package on my depedencylist linked below)

 	You do not have to install DS-5

   Last not least if you want to use usb-blaster jtag you need to add a udev rule:
